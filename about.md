<p class="about__head">
    Tech guy with an entrepreneurial spirit and knack for getting things done. Currently building <a href="https://meplis.dev">meplis.dev</a>.

I'm an experienced developer with a demonstrated history of working on large scale enterprise solutions. Additionally, I have a strong penchant to build and manage high-functioning development teams using my strong problem-solving and people skills.

Over my 11+ years of experience, I have heavily focused my attention on embedded software development of 3 years., fostering agile practices, patterns of enterprise application architecture, managing complexity in the systems, delivering solutions that are future proof, maintainable, and easily scalable, building and growing teams and mentoring the developers. I'm a quick learner who has a strong interest in emerging technologies and exceptional analytical/problem-solving skills.

I have been using C in school projects for three years and in professional business life for two years. I
continue my online courses in order to speak professionally about C and to communicate properly with
other programmers.
I am intermediate in C and beginner in C++. I used C in almost all of my university projects. In these
projects I have written code in C for PIC18F, MSP430 and ARM-Cortex with FPGA.I also used C in HLS
(High-Level Synthesis), which enables us to design hardware with C in FPGA. In my professional working
life, I used C in energy metering project, power management unit project, digital input/output slave device
project. Where C++ is used in the sample applications, project-specific arrangements are made and used in
my C++ projects.
